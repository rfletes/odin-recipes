    <p>On this website, we will be going over the step involved to bake some delicious Buffalo Wings!</p>
    <p>The recipes will include several steps and require an oven!</p>
    
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Flour</li>
        <li>Spices and Seasonings</li>
        <li>Chicken Wings</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Hot Sauce</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>First, combine flour, cayenne pepper, garlic powder, and salt in a zip-top bag. Add the chicken wings, seal tightly, and shake to coat. Transfer the coated wings to a prepared baking sheet and refrigerate for an hour. Mix the hot sauce and butter in a bowl. Dip each wing in the sauce, then return them to the baking sheet. Bake, turning halfway through the bake time, until the chicken is fully cooked and the skin is crispy.</li>
        <li>Next, cook the chicken wings for 45 minutes in an oven that's preheated to 400 degrees F. To test the chicken's doneness, insert an instant read thermometer into a meaty drumette (don't touch the bone). Chicken wings are ready-to-eat when the internal temperature reaches at least 165 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Lastly, grab some dipping sauce such as ranch and enjoy!</li>
